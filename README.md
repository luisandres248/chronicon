# Chronicon - Internal Developer Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Chronicon web application, intended for internal development teams. It details the project's current state, architectural decisions, technical stack, and key functionalities.

## 1. Project Overview

Chronicon is a single-page application (SPA) designed to help users manage and visualize personal events by integrating with their Google Calendar. It focuses on tracking recurring activities and important dates, leveraging a dedicated "Chronicon" calendar within the user's Google account.

## 2. Current Features

*   **Google Calendar Integration:** Seamlessly connects with the user's Google account for event data storage and retrieval.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure sign-in/sign-out using Google OAuth 2.0, managed client-side.
*   **Dedicated Chronicon Calendar:** Automatically creates and manages a specific "Chronicon" calendar within the user's Google Calendar, ensuring data isolation.
*   **Event Management (CRUD):** Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for events.
*   **Recurrence Handling:** Supports adding new occurrences to existing event series.
*   **Event Visualization:**
    *   **Grid View:** Displays events grouped by name, providing detailed statistics such as first/last occurrence, recurrence count, time since last event, and average gap between occurrences.
    *   **Calendar View:** Offers a traditional calendar interface for visualizing events chronologically.
*   **Event Import:** Functionality to import events from any user-selected Google Calendar into the Chronicon calendar, including calendar selection, event listing with checkboxes, and duplicate prevention.
*   **Theming:** Multiple Material UI themes are available (Light, Dark, Chronicon, Ocean Breeze, Sunset Glow), allowing users to customize the application's appearance.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Supports multiple languages, with English and Spanish currently implemented.
*   **User Configuration:** Persists user preferences (theme, date format, language) in local storage.
*   **Optimistic UI Updates:** Implemented for event update and delete operations, providing immediate UI feedback and rolling back changes only if the API call fails.
*   **Robust Token Management:** Automatic token refresh and retry mechanisms for Google API calls to handle token expiration gracefully.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend Framework:** React (v18)
*   **Build Tool:** Vite (v5)
*   **UI Library:** Material UI (MUI v5) with Emotion for styling.
*   **State Management:** React Context API
*   **Routing:** React Router DOM (v6)
*   **Date Management:** `date-fns`
*   **Internationalization:** `i18next` and `react-i18next`
*   **Google API Client:** Google API JavaScript Client Library (`gapi.client`) and Google Sign-In (GSI) library for client-side interaction with Google Calendar API.
*   **Recurrence Rules:** `rrule` for handling complex recurrence patterns (though currently used for simple recurrence creation).
*   **Color Picker:** `react-color`

## 4. Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure, organized for modularity and separation of concerns:

## 5. Architecture and Design Decisions

### 5.1. Client-Side Application (SPA)

Chronicon is implemented as a Single-Page Application (SPA) using React. All rendering and logic occur client-side, with direct interaction with Google APIs from the browser.

### 5.2. Centralized State Management (React Context API)

The application leverages React's Context API (`src/context/GlobalContext.jsx`) for global state management. This design choice centralizes all core application state (user, calendar, events, configuration, loading states) and business logic, providing a single source of truth and minimizing prop drilling.

*   **`GlobalContext.jsx` Responsibilities:**
    *   Manages application-wide state.
    *   Handles user authentication flow (sign-in, sign-out).
    *   Orchestrates Google Calendar API interactions via `googleService.js`.
    *   Implements optimistic UI updates for event modifications.
    *   Persists user configuration to `localStorage`.
    *   Manages various loading and error states for a responsive UX.

### 5.3. Service Layer for API Interaction

A dedicated `services` layer (`src/services/`) abstracts interactions with external APIs and handles data transformation:

*   **`googleService.js`:**
    *   Encapsulates all direct communication with Google APIs (Google Calendar API, Google Sign-In).
    *   Manages OAuth 2.0 authentication, including token acquisition, storage, and automatic refreshing.
    *   Handles the creation and retrieval of the dedicated "Chronicon" calendar.
    *   Provides CRUD operations for Google Calendar events.
    *   Includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls.
*   **`eventService.js`:**
    *   Acts as a data mapper, transforming event objects between the application's internal model and the Google Calendar API's format.
    *   Parses custom metadata (e.g., `tags`) stored in Google Calendar's `extendedProperties`.
    *   Provides utility functions for grouping events and calculating various event-related statistics (e.g., recurrence count, time since last occurrence).

### 5.4. Theming System (Material UI)

The application utilizes Material UI's theming capabilities to provide a consistent and customizable visual experience. Multiple predefined themes are available, and the user's selected theme is persisted.

### 5.5. Internationalization

The application supports internationalization using `i18next`, allowing for easy translation of UI elements into different languages. Translation files are located in `src/locales/`.

### 5.6. Data Persistence

*   **User Configuration:** Stored in `localStorage` for client-side persistence across sessions.
*   **Google Session Data:** Google API tokens, user profile, and Chronicon calendar ID are stored in `localStorage` to maintain user sessions.

### 5.7. Event Metadata Handling

Custom event metadata, such as `tags`, is stored securely and robustly using Google Calendar's `extendedProperties.private` field. This ensures that application-specific data is associated directly with the Google Calendar event without interfering with standard event fields.

### 5.8. Logging

A custom logging utility (`src/utils/logger.js`) is implemented to provide configurable logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR). This aids in development and debugging, with log levels dynamically adjustable via `sessionStorage` or `window` overrides.

### 5.9. Chronicon's Event Model and Deletion Logic

Chronicon adopts a specific model for what constitutes an "event," which differs from Google Calendar's native recurring event concept. In Chronicon:

*   **Event Definition:** An "event" is defined as a collection of individual Google Calendar entries that share the *exact same name (summary)*. This allows users to track activities or milestones that occur at irregular intervals but are conceptually part of the same ongoing series (e.g., "Project Alpha Milestone," "Annual Check-up").
*   **Event Creation:** When a user "adds an occurrence" of an existing event, Chronicon creates a new, standalone Google Calendar event with the same name as the original. It does *not* create or modify Google Calendar's native recurring event series.
*   **Deletion Logic:** When an "event" (as defined by Chronicon) is deleted from the grid view, the application identifies *all* Google Calendar entries that share the same name as the selected event. It then proceeds to delete each of these individual entries from Google Calendar. This ensures that the entire conceptual "event series" within Chronicon is removed, regardless of whether the underlying Google Calendar entries were part of a native recurring series or just multiple standalone events with identical names. This approach prioritizes Chronicon's internal event model for a consistent user experience.

## 6. Conventions

*   **Component Naming:** PascalCase for React components (e.g., `EventCard.jsx`).
*   **File Naming:** PascalCase for components, camelCase for services and utilities.
*   **Styling:** Primarily relies on Material UI components and their styling props. Minimal global CSS.
*   **State Management:** Prefers `useState` and `useContext` for local and global state respectively.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Uses `async/await` for handling promises.
*   **Error Handling:** Centralized error states in `GlobalContext` and `try...catch` blocks for API calls.
*   **Environment Variables:** Uses Vite's `import.meta.env` for environment-specific configurations (e.g., Google API keys).
